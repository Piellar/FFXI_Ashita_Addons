# maestro

Plays in-game music taken from the FFXI client files in areas that are normally silent.

The **settings.json** file allows you to fully customize which field and battle themes are associated to any zone ID.

You can thus choose another song for an area BGM that you don't like, and it will be played automatically upon zoning in.

Commands:

//maestro announce (Toggles chat announcements of BGM swaps)



Note:

Changing the moghouse, chocobo or a cutscene theme is currently not supported by this mod.
